Visitor class hierarchy

PortVisitor
    PortVisitor is the root of a hierarchy of Visitors that affect
    the behavior of a port.  A PortVisitor is for a specific Port; it
    carries the number of that Port.  A PortVisitor can be injected into
    the top of a Switch.  It will find its way to the right Port.

	PortDataVisitor
	    PortDataVisitor carries arbitrary data into and out of
	    a Port.  PortDataVisitors can leave a Switch.

	PortProtocolVisitor
	    PortProtocolVisitor carries protocol or control
	    information into a Port.  PortProtocolVisitors do not leave
	    the Switch.

		VPVCInstallerVisitor
		    VPVCInstallerVisitor instructs a Port to
		    construct a new Protocol path for a specific VPVC.
		    It carries the State object for the Protocol.

		VPVCUninstallerVisitor
		    VPVCUninstallerVisitor instructs a Port to
		    remove a Protocol path for a specific VPVC.


PortInstallerVisitor
    PortInstallerVisitor instructs a Switch to create a Port.  It
    carries the number of the new Port.  PortInstallerVisitors do not
    leave the Switch.

PortUninstallerVisitor
    PortUninstallerVisitor instructs a Switch to remove a Port.  It
    carries the number of the new Port.

StrikeBreakerVisitor
    StrikeBreakerVisitor instructs a Factory to resume making new
    Conduits.  Not all Factories understand the StrikeBreakerVisitor; they
    always create new Conduits.  When a StrikeBreakerVisitor encounters
    such a "non-union" Factory, it passes itself along to the next
    Conduit.  The StrikeBreakerVisitor commits Suicide() when it
    encounters a "union" Factory.  

BUG: A StrikeBreakerVisitor can leave the Switch if there are no
"union" Factories in the Switch.  This should not be!

StrikeVisitor
    StrikeBreakerVisitor instructs a Factory to stop making new
    Conduits.  Not all Factories understand the StrikeBreakerVisitor; they
    always create new Conduits.  When a StrikeBreakerVisitor encounters
    such a "non-union" Factory, it passes itself along to the next
    Conduit.  The StrikeBreakerVisitor commits Suicide() when it
    encounters a "union" Factory.

BUG: A StrikeVisitor can leave the Switch if there are no
"union" Factories in the Switch.  This should not be!
