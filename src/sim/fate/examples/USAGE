usage: parse.sh Scripts/foo.fc

This will generate foo_OS in the current directory.  

If you write a new script, please place it in the Scripts subdirectory.  
This reduces clutter in the working directory, and will make it easier 
to clean up unused binaries, without the accidental danger of deleting
scripts.
